This was originally intended as a minimalist http server implementation similar to (go)[https://pkg.go.dev/net/http]'s, but then my team started using (warp)[https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp] instead and I really like it and will not try and compete. 

I do not currently have a plan for what this crate will be used for.
